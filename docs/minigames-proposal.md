# SEWB Simulation

### Proposal

One approach would be to have a bunch of minigames.

### Interdimensional view

A core mechanic of the game is the hidden but real causes for a behavior. For example,


#### Life's daily battles

A video game where you fight baddies, your success is determined by strength in the other dimensions.

#### Culture

Timeline of events and cultural participation.

#### Causality

A causation loop map of various behaviors and their relationships to others

#### Country

Map of the land, notating current position, frequently traveled heatmap and points of interest for that person.

#### Government Policy

A graph of policies that effect the central person, with valency and strength indicating total effect on wellbeing

#### Ancestry / Family Tree 

A graph of the wellbeing of ancestors, with ability to recenter on that person

## Brainstorming

- a holistic framework should use holistic teaching
	- present content that has emotional impact
